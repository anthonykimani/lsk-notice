            <p>The Council through the Young Lawyers Committee chaired by <span> Byron Menezes, Council Member</span>, has organized a free webinar on <span>Managing a Law Firm: Setting Up, Management and Expectations.</span></p>
            <p>The Webinar seeks to identify the different needs, skill set and obligations in running a law firm, the basic elements that distinguish lawyers who set up law firms which succeed from those that that do not take off, with a focus on client care, billing, record management, financial planning.
